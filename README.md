## Our Valentine Website

This is a small two-page website built just for you.

- **Home page (`index.html`)**:  
  - Shows an animated counter for **how long you’ve known each other** (days/hours/minutes/seconds) starting from **3 October 2025** and updating forever.  
  - Shows an animated **countdown** to your Valentine’s Day on **14 February 2026**.  
  - Includes a round, glowing button labeled **“Love You”** that stays locked until your Valentine’s date has arrived.

- **Love letter page (`love.html`)**:  
  - Stays **locked** until the Valentine’s date.  
  - After that date, the **“Love You”** button opens this page.  
  - Contains an animated love letter with a romantic background, floating hearts, and falling kisses.
